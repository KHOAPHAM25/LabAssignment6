# LabAssignment6

For this lab, I used GITBASH to clone my folder from GITHUB I just made for Lab Assignment #6. I added the files given to us to folder given to us and push it to my GITHUB. After I successfully added the input.txt and main c file, I updated the c File to add the recurisve function on GITHUB. You can see all the commit history for verification.
